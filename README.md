# Inception of Things

A comprehensive Kubernetes learning project with hands-on labs and practical examples.

## Project Overview

This repository contains four progressive phases of Kubernetes learning, from basic cluster setup to GitOps practices with ArgoCD and Self-Managed GitLab.

## Helpful Guides

## Learning Phases

### Phase 1: Basic K3s Setup
- **Goal**: Set up a basic K3s cluster.
- **Tools**: Vagrant, VirtualBox, K3s.
- **Focus**: Cluster initialization, node setup, and basic concepts.

### Phase 2: Application Deployment And Ingress
- **Goal**: Deploy applications using Kubernetes manifests
- **Tools**: Plain YAML manifests, kubectl, K3s
- **Focus**: Services, Ingress, and application deployment

### Phase 3: GitOps with ArgoCD And K3d
- **Goal**: Implement GitOps workflow with ArgoCD
- **Tools**: ArgoCD, K3d, K3s, plain YAML manifests
- **Focus**: Continuous delivery and GitOps practices

### Phase 4: GitOps with Self-Managed GitLab
- **Goal**: Implement GitOps workflow with Self-Managed GitLab
- **Tools**: Self-Managed GitLab, K3s, K3d, ArgoCD
- **Focus**: Continuous delivery and GitOps practices
